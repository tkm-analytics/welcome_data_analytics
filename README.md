# Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Data Analysis Project repository. This project focuses on analyzing and deriving insights from the provided dataset through various data analysis techniques.

## Key Areas of Data Analysis:

- **Data Exploration:** In this phase, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and relationships. This helps in identifying patterns and trends that can guide further analysis.

- **Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset. Clean data is essential for accurate analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualizing data through charts, graphs, and plots helps in presenting the findings effectively. Visualizations make complex data easy to understand and interpret.

## Stages of Data Analysis

| Stage               | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Exploration     | Understanding the dataset's structure, variables, and relationships.                              |
| Data Cleaning        | Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.                               |
| Data Visualization   | Presenting insights and findings through charts, graphs, and plots.                                 |

By effectively managing these stages of the data analysis process, this project aims to uncover valuable insights from the dataset and support informed decision-making.
